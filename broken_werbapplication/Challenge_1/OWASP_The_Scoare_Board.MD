Uncovering the 'Score Board' page can be a tricky task. Ther is no link anywhere in the webapplicaion that would lead to it. This leaves two possible explanations: 
#

1) The link was missed while initially mapping the application, 
2) There is a URL that leads to the Score Board, but it is not hyperlinked. To locate the Score Board, one can either guess the URL that it might have or search for a reference or clue within the parts of the application that are not usually visible in the browser.
