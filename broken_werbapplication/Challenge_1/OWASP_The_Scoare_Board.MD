Uncovering the 'Score Board' page can be a tricky task. During the "happy path" tour, it was not visited because there was no link anywhere in the application that would lead to it. This leaves two possible explanations: 

1) the link was missed while initially mapping the application, 
2) there is a URL that leads to the Score Board, but it is not hyperlinked. To locate the Score Board, one can either guess the URL that it might have or search for a reference or clue within the parts of the application that are not usually visible in the browser.
